In this lab I implemented a simple hash table and used it to count unique appearances of words in 
text files. The hashing algorithm is from page 319 of "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in 
Java" Third Edition. Linear Probing was used to for collision avoidance, and a maximum load factor 
of <.50 (<50%) is permitted before the storage array is resized (doubled) and the table rehashed into 
the new array. There are only two classes in this implementation: HTable, which is the hash table 
class, and HTest, which contains the main method and implements file io and console output.
