In telecommunication, Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes that generalize the Hamming(7,4)-code,
and were invented by Richard Hamming in 1950. Hamming codes can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors
without detection of uncorrected errors. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can detect only
an odd number of bits in error. Hamming codes are perfect codes, that is, they achieve the highest possible rate for
codes with their block length and minimum distance of three.[1]
